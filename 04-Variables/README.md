# 04-Variables

This is a learning exercise from the [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) tutorial series.

## Purpose

Describes how to declare and name variables.

## Notes

- Key takeaways:
  - ...Use "let" to declare variables.
  - ...Give variables descriptive names.
  - ...Older code may use var instead of let.
  - ...Use const to declare a variable that you don't want changed.
  - ...When using const, capitalize variable names if you know their unchanging value ahead of time.
