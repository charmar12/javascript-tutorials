# 10-Conditional-Branching-If-Question-Mark

This folder contains my practice code for the "10-Conditional-Branching-If-?" section of [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/).

## Files

- `official-name.js`
- `rewrite-if-else-into-question-mark.js`
- `rewrite-if-into-question-mark.js`
- `show-the-sign.html`
- `sign.js`
- `the-name-of-javascript.html`

## Notes

Key takeaways:
- If-else statements seem very similar to Python with different syntax.
- Formatting with a question mark lets you significantly shorten code.
- Keep it to one idea per line for readability.
