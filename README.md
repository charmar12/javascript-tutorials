# JavaScript Practice – Exercises from javascript.info

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises found throughout [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/), an in-depth modern JavaScript tutorial.

## Purpose

This project serves as a structured learning log as I work through the javascript.info curriculum. Each folder represents a chapter containing exercises, with my code organized accordingly.

Although this repo is primarily for my own learning, it’s public in case others find it useful to compare approaches or track their own progress.

## Structure

- Organized by topic (chapter), based on the order of the javascript.info course.
- Only chapters containing exercises are included — for example, it skips from Chapter 1 to Chapter 4 because the intervening sections contain no practical exercises.

## Notes

- Code is written to run in the browser unless otherwise noted.
- Comments are included to explain logic or document uncertainties I worked through.
- This is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue through the material.

## Credits

All exercises are derived from the excellent content at [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/), created by Ilya Kantor.
