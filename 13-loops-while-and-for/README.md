# 13-loops-while-and-for

This folder contains my practice code for the "13-loops-while-and-for" section of [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/).

## Files

- `output-even-numbers-in-the-loop.js`
- `output-prime-numbers.js`
- `repeat-until-the-input-is-correct.js`
- `replace-for-with-while.js`

## Notes

Key takeaways:
- To this point loops work very similarly to those in Python, with different syntax.
