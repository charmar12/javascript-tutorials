# 15-functions

This folder contains my practice code for the "15-functions" section of [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/).

## Files

- `funtion-min-a-b.js`
- `function-pow-x-n.html`
- `function-pow-x-n.js`
- `rewrite-the-function-using-question-mark-or-or.js`

## Notes

- This was largely a review of what I learned about functions in Python.
- Remember to follow the practice of assigning only one task per function.
- Name functions with a verb and an object in camel case(e.g., printResult).
