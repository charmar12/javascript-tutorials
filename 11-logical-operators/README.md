# 11-logical-operators

This folder contains my practice code for the "11-logical-operators" section of [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/).

## Files

- `check-the-login.html` 
- `check-the-range-between.js`
- `check-the-range-outside.js`
- `login.js`

## Notes

Key takeaways:
- || (or), && (and) and ! (not) behave in expected ways, except that JavaScript also uses "truthy" and "falsy" values that these operators can return.
- === is preferred to == to ensure strict equality.
